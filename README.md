# Unsupervised Learning Challenge

Objective:

You’ll combine your financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that you acquired in this module.

You’ll create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. You’ll then plot the 
results so that you can visually show the performance to the board.

The provided CSV file contains the price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.
